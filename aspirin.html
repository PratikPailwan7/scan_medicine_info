    <h1>Chemical Information of Aspirin</h1>

    <p><strong>Chemical Name:</strong> Acetylsalicylic Acid</p>
    <p><strong>Molecular Weight:</strong> 180.157 gm/mole</p>
    <p><strong>Molecular Formula:</strong> C₉H₈O₄</p>
    <p><strong>Mass Percent:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>C: 60.001%</li>
        <li>H: 4.4758%</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Synthesis of Aspirin</h2>
    <p>Aspirin is synthesized through an esterification reaction between salicylic acid and acetic anhydride, which is catalyzed by an acid like sulfuric acid or phosphoric acid. This reaction converts the hydroxyl group of salicylic acid into an ester group, producing aspirin and acetic acid as byproducts.</p>
    <p><strong>Chemical Reaction:</strong></p>
    
    <h2>Uses</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>At high doses (300mg), aspirin can relieve pain, reduce a high temperature (fever), and reduce swelling.</li>
        <li>Aspirin is often used for short-term relief from headaches, migraines, period pains, general aches, colds, and flu.</li>
        <li>Long-term treatment with low doses of aspirin (75mg) has an antiplatelet effect to stop blood clots developing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Aspirin Side Effects</h2>
    <p><strong>Emergency Medical Help:</strong></p>
    <p>Call your doctor if you experience symptoms like ringing in the ears, confusion, vomiting, blood in stools, or fever lasting longer than 3 days.</p>

    <h2>Common Side Effects:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Upset stomach</li>
        <li>Heartburn</li>
        <li>Drowsiness</li>
        <li>Mild headache</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Drug Interactions</h2>
    <p>Ask your doctor before using aspirin if you're on antidepressants or blood thinners. Certain drugs like citalopram, warfarin, and others can interact with aspirin.</p>

    <h2>Warnings</h2>
    <p>You should not use aspirin if you have a bleeding disorder, a recent history of stomach bleeding, or are allergic to NSAIDs.</p>

    <h2>Dose</h2>
    <p>Follow your doctor's instructions for dosage based on your condition.</p>

    <h2>Mechanism of Action</h2>
    <p>Aspirin works by reducing inflammation, pain, fever, and blood clotting by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX) enzyme, which leads to reduced production of prostaglandins and thromboxanes.</p>
